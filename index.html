    <h2>The Man Behind The Curtain</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm a young software engineer who is passionate about technology, with a specific interest in web development and design. I have many interests and several hobbies, and I enjoy meeting new people and exploring new places. Thanks for visiting my site! Leave me a message below, or mouse over the "Contact" button to see where you can reach me. Later!
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    I was born and raised in Plainfield, New Jersey. I went to a Magnet high school for math, science and technology, which was where I discovered my fascination with the world of engineering and technology. Like most of my classmates, this led me to pursue a STEM field in college. I went on to earn a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from New Jersey Institute of Technology. This path has taught me so much, and I am constantly in awe of the things we've been able to accomplish through advancements in this field.<br /><br />
    In college, I was put through a rigorous academic curriculum that covered computer hardware and software. It was quite taxing, so taxing in fact that a large percentage of my classmates ended up changing their majors in the journey from freshmen to graduates. I was proud to earn my little piece of paper, and it represents a lot to me. Upon graduating, I received a full-time job offer from PNC's Asset Management Group for the position of Business Systems Analyst. I did an internship with PNC the summer of my junior year, which was an enjoyable and informative experience, giving me time to see what working in the industry was like well before I graduated. This position taught me a lot of things that I did not have the opportunity learn in school. I was able to facilitate and build relationships with the business partners that drove the requests for innovation and design that software engineers were tasked with.<br /><br />
    After spending a year in this position, it was time to return to my home: software engineering. I made a job switch within my group at PNC, and got right back into programming...on a mainframe system. I've directly employed some of the things that I learned in school, however I have a rather insatiable curiosity for the technologies that influence my daily life: web technology! Everything we do is touched some way with connectivity to the web, and being able to influence that landscape is something that would bring me great fulfillment. Therefore, I seek to continue this journey of learning into a vast new wilderness. Who knows what I'll find!

    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
    Here's where things get interesting. I've always been an eclectic guy, and the things I do in my spare time reflect that. To start, I've always been a reader. Fiction, nonfiction, psychology, philosophy, history, etc. Whatever will expand my mind in some way, I will pick up and read. And I'm somewhat old-fashioned, because I prefer a hard copy of a book to a tablet or e-reader version. Recent reads are Outliers by Malcom Gladwell, A Game Of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, and Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe.<br /><br />
    Music is also a huge passion of mine. I'm really into the art of rap and hip-hop, as well as R&amp;B, and the classics that my parents listened to growing up. I've been discovering some new artists recently that branch out radically from these genres, which is pretty exciting. But in short, I could talk about my favorite music for hours. I played the flute and piano growing up, but my instrumental skills have kind of laid dormant...until I find the time to pick them back up again and start practicing.<br /><br />
    Here's one thing that tends to surprise people: I am no stranger to the dance floor. Dancing is an incredibly fun outlet for me, and coupled with  my passion for music, I'm bound to have a great time. But it's not just limited to one genre. I can dance salsa, bachata, even waltz, swing, and hip-hop. I've learned a lot from participating in different cultures, and each one has their own flavor. Filipino, Spanish, Indian, and Carribeans all dance differently, and I've never been afraid to make a fool of myself in order to learn something new from each one.<br /><br />
    So that's just a few things that occupy my mind and my time. I also enjoy playing my PS3, and I will gladly pack a bag and journey to a new city that I've never been to before. My travels have yet to take me outside of the U.S, (besides Canada) but I've set my sights globally. I hope you've enjoyed getting to know a little about me, and I look forward to meeting you in person!
